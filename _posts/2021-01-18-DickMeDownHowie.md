Here is also my favorite robot [article](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/). It's about the hypothetical paperclip robot apocalypse. 

# Sensing
The camera at the top will be able to view the surrounding terrain.
# Planning
The CPU in the center will take the sensing input and compute a path.
# Acting
The CPU will relay commands to the motors on the tracks to guide the robot.
